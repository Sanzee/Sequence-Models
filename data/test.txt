Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .	JJ NN NN POS CD NN NN MD VB IN JJ NN NN IN NN TO JJ NN NNS , CC JJ JJ NN MD VB DT NN VB PRP$ JJ NN NN , DT NN POS JJ NN VBD .
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .

So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .	RB RB DT NN NNP , WP$ JJ NN VBZ NNP NNP IN NNP NNP , VBZ VBN CD CD NNS IN NNS IN CD CD NNS .
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .	PRP VBZ VBN CD CD NNS .
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .	NNP NNP MD RB VB WRB JJ JJR CD NNS CC NN NN MD VB CC VBD NNS IN VBG JJ NNS MD VB IN DT NN POS JJ JJ NNS RB VBP IN NN TO NN .
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .	" DT NN IN NN VBZ JJ IN RB PRP MD VB DT RB IN CD CC CD NNS IN NN VBZ RB JJ , " NNP NNP VBD IN JJ JJ NN NN , RB IN CD NNS .

Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .

Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim .	NNP VBZ JJ VBN IN NNP IN NNP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNP .
Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd.

Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .	NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN VBD VBN NNP IN VBG NNS IN NN IN NN , WDT VBD VBN TO DT NN IN DT NN POS NNS .
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .	PRP VBD NN NNS MD RB VB IN DT NN IN NN NN .
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .

Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , " he said .	PRP VBP IN DT NN TO PRP$ NNS VBZ DT NN WDT MD VB DT JJ NNS , " PRP VBD .
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .

He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .	PRP VBD PRP$ NN MD VB RB RP VBG IN PRP$ VBG NN , NNP NNP NNP , WDT VBZ IN CD NN IN NNS CC VBZ DT NN POS JJ NN .

Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil .	NN NN VBZ NN IN NNP .

Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .	NN NN VBZ JJ , RB IN NNS , IN NNS VBP JJ IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT JJS NN NNS , VBD DT NNS IN DT JJ JJ JJ NN NN WDT VBD IN NNP .
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said .	DT NN IN NN NNS IN NNP VBZ VBN CD NN TO DT VBN CD DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD VBN IN NNP CD , NNP NNP , DT NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP NNP ( NNP ) , VBD .
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .	DT NN IN NNS IN NNS VBD RB RBR : IN CD NN , IN CD IN CD TO CD IN CD , PRP VBD .

Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme said .	PRP$ NNS VBP DT JJS IN NN , " NNP VBD .
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .	" PRP VBP DT NN IN NN NNS IN NNS NNS IN DT NNS IN DT NN NN .
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . "	NNS VBP TO VB DT RBR JJ NN TO VB IN DT NN NN , VBN DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNP POS NN . "
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .	DT JJ NN NN , NN NN CC JJ JJ NNS VBP RB RB VBN NN , VBG JJR NN JJ IN JJ NN .
Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy .	NNP VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN JJ NN IN NNS CC VBZ NN TO CD IN DT RBS JJ NNS , NNP NNP .
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .	EX VBP CD NN NNS RB , IN WDT CD VBP VBN TO VB NNS IN DT NNP .
Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .	DT NN , CD JJ NN NNS NN IN NNP CC JJ NNS IN DT IN DT NN VB TO VB RB .
Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "	VB NNS NNP POS NN IN JJ NN RB TO JJ NN CC TO DT NN POS NN CC NN IN JJ NNS , WDT MD VB JJ NNS . "
What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said .	WP VBZ VBZ DT NN RB VBZ RB VB DT NN CC DT NNS VBP RB VB IN DT NNS , " PRP VBD .
Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .	NNP POS RBS JJ NN NN VBZ NN IN WDT JJ VBZ VBN RB IN NNS IN DT NN , IN IN CD NNS DT NN IN DT NN IN $ CD TO $ CD DT .
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .	NN NNS CC NN NNS VBP RB JJ IN DT JJ NN VBZ IN JJ NNS , CC IN NNS RB NNS VBP TO VB NN NNS CC NN NNS .
