Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .	IN TO CD NNS IN NN VBN IN NNP VBN NNS , VBG DT NN NN IN TO PRP$ NN CC JJ NN , RB VBZ TO NNP POS JJ NN NN , NN NNS VBD IN NNP .
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .	IN CD NNS IN DT NN VBP RB VBN VBN TO NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NNP , WRB DT IN DT JJ NN VBD VBN , PRP VBD .
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .	RB WP VBZ DT NN VBZ DT NN WDT VBZ VBN NNS CC NN NNS VBG IN DT NN VBD VBN IN NNP IN DT NNP NNP NNP NNPS NN CC NNP NNP ( NNP ) IN NNP CC NNP .
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .	PRP VBD JJ IN CC RB DT CD NNS VBD VBN NNS : WDT MD VB DT NN NN IN DT JJ NN , VBN RB IN DT JJ NN POS NNP NNP NNP , VBD DT NN .
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .	NNS VBP VBN DT NN MD VB NNS IN NNS : CD NN NN NN CC CD NN JJ NN : IN VBD DT NN RB JJ RB .
But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .	CC CD NN , DT NN IN DT NNP NNP NN NN , VBD PRP VBD DT NN IN DT NN VBD NNS VBD CC RB .
" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .	" IN PRP VBP PDT DT NN VBG DT NN TO NNP , PRP MD VB VBG EX IN NNS , " PRP VBD .
" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .

Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .	NN NNS RB VBD PRP MD VB JJ TO VB DT NN RB IN DT VBN JJ NN IN PRP VBD RB VBN PRP$ NN IN VBG NN IN JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP NNP ( NNP ) .
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .	DT NN VBZ WRB DT NN NN IN DT NN VBZ JJR IN DT JJ NN .
CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .	NNP VBD IN CD NNS IN NN IN DT NNP IN NNP CC NNP CD IN NN IN DT NN NN , VBG DT NN NN IN TO CD NNS IN CD VBZ RB .
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .	NNS IN NNP VBD NNP MD RB VB VBN PRP TO DT NN IN IN $ CD DT NN , CC RB VBN RB IN $ CD CC $ CD DT NN WRB PRP VBD VBG DT NN RB RBR DT NN .
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .	DT MD VB VBN VBD DT JJ NN , WDT MD RB VB VBN VBN TO VB NN CC JJ NNS .
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .	NN IN NNP VBD VBN DT NN TO JJ NN NNS IN DT NN IN JJ NNS JJ DT RB JJ NN .
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( BME ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .	NN NNS NNP NNP NNP ( NNP ) VBD IN NNP DT NN IN DT NNS IN DT CD NNS , " WP PRP VBP , VBZ DT RBS JJ JJ JJ " IN DT RB JJ NN NN .
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .

A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 .

Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia , will be no easy matter .

A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny .

The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote .	DT JJ NN VBG NNS , WDT VBD VBN JJ NNP , VBD VBN IN DT JJ NN .

Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .	NNS CC NN NNS VBP NNS CC NNS VBD IN VBN TO VB DT JJ NN IN DT NN .

The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday .	DT NN IN DT JJ NN IN NNP POS JJ NN NN NNS TO VB TO VB DT JJ NN , NN NNS VBD IN NNP .

Hatoyama , the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister , on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old Takemura , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force .

Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura , seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDP-dominated coalition .

The presence of Takemura , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled Hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said .

The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .

We will ask the ( EU ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters .	PRP MD VB DT ( NNP ) JJ CC JJ NN TO VB PRP , " NNP NN NNP NNP VBD NNP .
But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its 14 EU partners .

The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle .

Compared with the end of last year , when T&N predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , Hope said : " I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half .

Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins .	NNP NNP VBZ NNP POS NN IN NNP VBZ .

NEW YORK	NNP NNP
The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected .	DT NN IN DT NNP NNS VBD IN DT JJ NN IN NNP NNP DT NN IN JJ NNS VBD IN NNP NNP MD VB DT JJ NN IN NNP NN IN NNP NNP VBZ VBN .
Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .	NN VBD IN DT NN NNS IN NNP POS NN FW NN VBZ VBN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT NN .
Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week .	NN IN NNP MD RB VB IN PRP$ NN VBD IN PRP VBD NNS IN DT JJ NNP NN IN NN NNS IN DT JJ NN IN NNP DT NN .
Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him .	MD NNP VBP , NNP NNP MD VB IN PRP MD VB PRP$ JJ NN IN PRP .
Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan .	NNP POS NN IN DT NNP , NNP NNP , VBD VBN IN NN IN DT IN DT JJ NNS WP VBD PRP VBD VBN TO VB RP DT NN TO VB DT NN IN NN NNS IN NNP .
" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. " Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . "	" RB , IN DT NNP NN , PRP VBP VBN CD RB JJ NN NNS , " VBD NNP NNP , DT JJ NN IN NNP NNPS NNP " IN NNP , DT NNP VBZ RB VBN IN DT JJ NN . "
That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 .	DT NN , VBD RP IN JJ NNS IN JJ JJ NN NN , VBD DT NN NN RB IN NNP NNP NNP NNS IN CD JJ NNS IN NNP CD , CD , CC CD JJ NNS IN NNP CD , CD .
Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .	RB , DT NN VBZ IN RB CD NNS CC CD NN .
Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs and Co .

Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets .	NN IN DT JJ NNP NN MD VB DT NN TO NNP NN MD VB NN IN JJ NNS .
Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening .	DT JJ NNS MD VB RB IN VBG NNP NNS CC NNS CC RB VB PRP WRB DT NN VBZ VBG .
As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury .	IN IN NNP NNP NNS , NNP VBD IN NNP NNP POS NN IN NN IN DT NNP NNP CC DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD RBR JJ IN IN NNP VBZ IN DT NNP .
" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States , " said Widness , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds .

Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results .	RB , NNS MD VB JJ TO VB IN DT NNP NN IN DT JJ NN NN VBZ VBN JJ NNS .
If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency .	IN DT VBZ JJ , RB DT JJ NNP JJ MD VB TO VB RB JJ IN NNP IN JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP VBZ RB VB DT JJ NN .
" If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? '	" IN PRP VBD , DT JJ NN NNS MD VB DT JJ NN VBZ , '' WP VBZ PRP$ NN IN DT NN . ''
" said Michael Perelstein , portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds .	" VBD NNP NNP , NN NN IN NNP NNP NNP .

Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .	JJ NN NN POS CD NN NN MD VB IN JJ NN NN IN NN TO JJ NN NNS , CC JJ JJ NN MD VB DT NN VB PRP$ JJ NN NN , DT NN POS JJ NN VBD .
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .

So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .	RB RB DT NN NNP , WP$ JJ NN VBZ NNP NNP IN NNP NNP , VBZ VBN CD CD NNS IN NNS IN CD CD NNS .
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .	PRP VBZ VBN CD CD NNS .
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .	NNP NNP MD RB VB WRB JJ JJR CD NNS CC NN NN MD VB CC VBD NNS IN VBG JJ NNS MD VB IN DT NN POS JJ JJ NNS RB VBP IN NN TO NN .
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .	" DT NN IN NN VBZ JJ IN RB PRP MD VB DT RB IN CD CC CD NNS IN NN VBZ RB JJ , " NNP NNP VBD IN JJ JJ NN NN , RB IN CD NNS .

Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .

Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim .	NNP VBZ JJ VBN IN NNP IN NNP VBZ DT JJ NN IN NNP .
Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd.

Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .	NNP NNP VBD DT JJ NN VBD VBN NNP IN VBG NNS IN NN IN NN , WDT VBD VBN TO DT NN IN DT NN POS NNS .
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .	PRP VBD NN NNS MD RB VB IN DT NN IN NN NN .
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .

Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers , " he said .	PRP VBP IN DT NN TO PRP$ NNS VBZ DT NN WDT MD VB DT JJ NNS , " PRP VBD .
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .

He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .	PRP VBD PRP$ NN MD VB RB RP VBG IN PRP$ VBG NN , NNP NNP NNP , WDT VBZ IN CD NN IN NNS CC VBZ DT NN POS JJ NN .

Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil .	NN NN VBZ NN IN NNP .

Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .	NN NN VBZ JJ , RB IN NNS , IN NNS VBP JJ IN PRP$ JJ NN IN DT JJS NN NNS , VBD DT NNS IN DT JJ JJ JJ NN NN WDT VBD IN NNP .
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said .	DT NN IN NN NNS IN NNP VBZ VBN CD NN TO DT VBN CD DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD VBN IN NNP CD , NNP NNP , DT NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP NNP ( NNP ) , VBD .
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .	DT NN IN NNS IN NNS VBD RB RBR : IN CD NN , IN CD IN CD TO CD IN CD , PRP VBD .

Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme said .	PRP$ NNS VBP DT JJS IN NN , " NNP VBD .
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .	" PRP VBP DT NN IN NN NNS IN NNS NNS IN DT NNS IN DT NN NN .
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy . "	NNS VBP TO VB DT RBR JJ NN TO VB IN DT NN NN , VBN DT JJ NNS IN NNP NNP POS NN . "
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .	DT JJ NN NN , NN NN CC JJ JJ NNS VBP RB RB VBN NN , VBG JJR NN JJ IN JJ NN .
Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy .	NNP VBZ VBN IN DT NN IN JJ NN IN NNS CC VBZ NN TO CD IN DT RBS JJ NNS , NNP NNP .
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .	EX VBP CD NN NNS RB , IN WDT CD VBP VBN TO VB NNS IN DT NNP .
Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there .	DT NN , CD JJ NN NNS NN IN NNP CC JJ NNS IN DT IN DT NN VB TO VB RB .
Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "	VB NNS NNP POS NN IN JJ NN RB TO JJ NN CC TO DT NN POS NN CC NN IN JJ NNS , WDT MD VB JJ NNS . "

Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .	NNP POS RBS JJ NN NN VBZ NN IN WDT JJ VBZ VBN RB IN NNS IN DT NN , IN IN CD NNS DT NN IN DT NN IN $ CD TO $ CD DT .
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .	NN NNS CC NN NNS VBP RB JJ IN DT JJ NN VBZ IN JJ NNS , CC IN NNS RB NNS VBP TO VB NN NNS CC NN NNS .
